Some earlier classification systems have recognized as many as 170 genera and 7,000 species in the family, most of which are now placed in other families. This entire larger group is still often referred to as polypodiaceous ferns, however, because all exhibit certain characteristics considered to be evolutionarily advanced—i.e., long-stalked, spore-producing structures (sporangia) characterized by the presence of an incomplete, vertically arranged band of thick-walled cells (annulus). In addition, members of the presently recognized family are mostly tropical and subtropical epiphytes (plants not rooted in soil but growing upon other plants) with a rootlike creeping stem (rhizome) covered with distinctive scales. The lower surfaces of the leaves bear round or oblong clusters of sporangia (sori) that usually lack the protective membranous covering (indusium) found in many other fern families. The genera are distinguished by numerous characteristics such as presence and type of plant hairs on stems and leaves, arrangement of sori, rhizome type, growth habit, and others. The limits of the family and many of its included genera are still in need of study.",

The members of the Arecales are distinctive in geography and habit; all but a very few species are restricted to the tropics and subtropics, where they make up a prominent part of the vegetation. Characteristically woody, they stand out within the largely herbaceous monocotyledons (monocots). The family is fourth among monocotyledonous families in size, after the Orchidaceae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae. Palms have been difficult to study for several reasons. Their large size and extreme hardness deterred early collectors, which led Liberty Hyde Bailey, an eminent American horticulturist during the early 20th century, to call palms the big game of the plant world. Many genera are island endemics. Notwithstanding their importance, they remained poorly known until air travel to remote tropical areas became feasible. Increased botanical exploration of the tropics in the 1980s established the importance of palms, which resulted in measures for studying and conserving them.",

Although species of the family grow throughout the world, except in cold alpine or arctic regions, most of them are found in temperate or tropical regions. The family consists of annual and perennial herbs and woody shrubs or trees as well as a few climbers. Flowers are of one sex, and male and female flowers are usually borne on the same plant. Petals are rarely present. Flowers of the largest genus, Euphorbia, are in cup-shaped clusters called cyathia, each of which seems to be a single female flower but actually consists of a single pistil surrounded by several male flowers, each of which has a single stamen. These clusters of reduced flowers are enclosed by an involucre (whorl) of bracts (modified leaves) that resembles a corolla, or whorl of flower petals. Male flowers of the other genera have one to many stamens, free or joined. Female flowers have three-chambered ovaries that are superior (that is, above, not enclosed by, other flower parts). There are as many styles as there are ovary cavities. The fruit is a three-chambered capsule.
